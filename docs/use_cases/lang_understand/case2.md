## 需求

给这段话划分语块，语块比固定搭配粒度略粗一些，语块之间要用/分隔，注意一句话应该有多个语块：

备选 prompt：
请将以下文本分成多个语块，每个语块应该包含一个完整的思想或信息单元。使用斜杠(/)来分隔这些语块，以便模拟阅读文章时的自然停顿和换气。请注意，一句话中要包含多个语块，语块的界定类似于固定搭配的粒度：

Okay, I'm gonna hold to that, but a lot has happened between when I first met you and now. You came to deal with being boring, that's for sure. Well, actually, it's taken by a driver boring, Kony — driver boring Kony2012. You came to DealBook and sat on this stage, and we're thrilled to have you back. But there's been so much that's happened between now and then, and there's been so much that's happened in the past week, week and a half. And a lot of folks, and I want to tell you this elevator, a lot of folks called me up and said, 'Are you really going to host Elon Musk here? Can you believe what he just said on Twitter, on 1X, on?' Yeah, yeah, no idea what this Twitter thing is about. 'Should you platform him?' That's what they said. 'Yeah, did you platform then?' I said that I think it's our role. And I know you have issues with journalists as a platform, and I know you have an issue with journalists often times, but I said it's our role to have conversations and to inquire and to sometimes even interrogate ideas, and that's what I'm hoping.
