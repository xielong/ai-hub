## 需求

给这段话划分语块，语块比固定搭配粒度略粗一些，语块之间要用/分隔，注意一句话应该有多个语块：

To start, let's say you have a single server which is accepting and fulfilling requests for your application. But now, we're getting more users, so we need to scale it. The easiest thing to do would be to add more resources, like RAM, or maybe upgrade your CPU. This is known as vertical scaling. It's pretty easy, but it's very limited. A better approach would be to add replicas so that each server can handle a subset of requests. This is known as horizontal scaling. It's more powerful because we can almost scale infinitely, and we don't even need good machines. It also adds redundancy and fault tolerance because if one of our servers goes down, all of the other servers can continue to fulfill requests. This eliminates our previous single point of failure. But the downside is that this approach is much more complicated.
